- symbols left to match:
  public static final int STR_CONST = 40;
  public static final int EOF = 0;
  public static final int error = 1;
  public static final int ERROR = 23;
  public static final int DARROW = 17;
  public static final int LET_STMT = 9;
  public static final int BOOL_CONST = 42;

- collapse all rules under the same state
- match true/false as BOOL_CONST instread of keyword

- report error using "return new Symbol(TokenConstants.ERROR...)". 
    Specified in p.4 that lexer should not print anything. 



UNCLEAR:
- lineno at the beginning or the end? (e.g. multiple line string)
- Handling EOF for string: what to we return in teh %eofval bracelet?
